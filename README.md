_Command palette in Craft; Because you can_

## Functionality

When you install this plugin, you'll have the ability to show a command palette when you navigate through the backend in Craft.

You can open the command palette by using the keyboard combination: (command key for Apple users) CTRL + SHIFT + P, or you can use the button that'll be added to the header actions.

The command palette will show admin functions if you are logged in as an admin, and all available sections (non Single) that the user has access to.

It's equipped with fuzzy search!

Use the keyboard arrows (up and down) to navigate to your desired command.

When you hit the return key or click on a command, the command palette will navigate to the location and show what it's loading.

You can close the command by either clicking anywhere on the page (besides the command palette) or by pressing the ESC key.
